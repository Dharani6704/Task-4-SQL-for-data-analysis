# Task-4-SQL-for-data-analysis

This project demonstrates core SQL skills for data extraction and analysis using a loan application database.

## Project Objective

The goal was to practice various SQL techniques to query and manipulate data, including:
- Basic queries with `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY`.
- Using aggregate functions like `SUM` and `AVG`.
- Writing subqueries to perform more complex data analysis.
- Performing `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations.

## Tasks Covered
- **Task 2: Data Insertion and Handling Nulls:** Populating the database with loan application records and managing missing values.
- **Task 4: SQL for Data Analysis:** Executing a series of analytical queries to derive insights from the data.

## Tools Used

- **MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite:** Any SQL database environment.
- **DB Fiddle / SQLiteStudio:** Tools used to execute the queries.
